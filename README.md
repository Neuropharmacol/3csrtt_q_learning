### Caution.
It is noted that jupyter-vim was installed in default docker image.  
If you use `docker-compose up` and use `toshiaki0910/3csrtt:v03` image, your default editor in jupyter lab is vim. There are three editing modes (Jupyter/Vim/Insert modes). For detail, see https://github.com/jwkvam/jupyterlab-vim.
